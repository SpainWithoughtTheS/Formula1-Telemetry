# F1 Telemetry Predictor

This Python project uses the FastF1 library to fetch telemetry data for Formula 1 races, and integrates with the Ergast API to retrieve driver names. The project also includes weather data and pit stop information for a selected race session and driver. The telemetry data is visualized with a scatter plot showing the driver's speed over the circuit layout.

## Features:
- Fetches race data for a specific year and Grand Prix.
- Displays available drivers for a chosen race.
- Retrieves telemetry data for the fastest lap of the selected driver.
- Displays weather information (if available) and pit stops for the session.
- Plots telemetry data using `matplotlib` for visual analysis.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.7+
- `requests` library
- `fastf1` library
- `matplotlib` library
- `pandas` library
- Internet connection to fetch data from the Ergast API and FastF1 API.

## Installation Instructions:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/f1-telemetry-predictor.git
   cd f1-telemetry-predictor
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended):
   If you're using Python 3.7+ (recommended), you can create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   On Windows:
   ```bash
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   On macOS/Linux:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required dependencies using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   The `requirements.txt` file should include the following:
   ```
   requests
   fastf1
   matplotlib
   pandas
   ```

## Usage:

1. **Run the Script**:
   After setting up, you can run the script to fetch telemetry data and display it:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Follow the Prompts**:
   - Enter the **name of the race** (e.g., `Silverstone`, `Monaco`).
   - Enter the **year** of the race (e.g., `2020`, `2021`).
   - Choose a driver by selecting a number corresponding to the available drivers for that session.

3. **View Telemetry and Visuals**:
   - The telemetry of the fastest lap for the selected driver will be plotted.
   - Weather and pit stop information will be displayed in the console.

## Debugging and Troubleshooting:

If you encounter any issues, use the following tips for debugging:

1. **Check for Missing Libraries**:
   If you get an error about missing libraries, make sure all required libraries are installed by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Ensure Proper Session Loading**:
   If the script fails to load a session, ensure that:
   - The race name and year are correct.
   - The race data is available in the FastF1 library for the specified year and race.
   - The internet connection is active for fetching the data.

3. **Pit Stop and Weather Data Missing**:
   Some races may not have detailed pit stop or weather data. If you encounter a KeyError or missing information, ensure the column or attribute exists by checking the session data structure.

4. **Check Session Availability**:
   If no lap data is available or the script doesn't display any telemetry:
   - Double-check that the driver has participated in the session.
   - Some sessions may not have laps or telemetry data available.

5. **Verbose Debug Output**:
   You can add extra print statements or logs in the code to display detailed information during execution. For example, if you're unsure about the structure of the session's data:
   ```python
   print(session.__dict__)  # This will show the session object structure
   ```

6. **API Rate Limits**:
   If the script encounters API rate limits, wait for a while and try again. Ergast API and FastF1 may have limitations on the number of requests per minute.

## Example Output:
After running the script and selecting a driver, you will see output similar to:

```
Available drivers in British Grand Prix 2020:
1. Hamilton, Lewis (44)
2. Bottas, Valtteri (77)
3. Verstappen, Max (33)
4. Leclerc, Charles (16)
...
Enter the driver number (e.g., 1 for first driver): 1
Selected driver: Hamilton, Lewis (44)
Weather: Cloudy, 22°C
Number of Pit Stops: 2
```

A plot will be displayed showing the telemetry of the fastest lap, with speed variations across the circuit.

## Debug Info:
If you encounter errors or unexpected behavior, the following debug information can be helpful:
- **Error Loading Session**: Ensure the race name and year are correct and that the race session exists in FastF1.
- **No Lap Data Found**: Make sure the race has data available for the selected year.
- **Pit Stop Column Missing**: Not all sessions include pit stop data. You can handle this by checking if the column exists (`'PitStop' in session.laps.columns`).
- **Weather Data Unavailable**: Weather data might not be available for all races. You can check the `session.weather` attribute to ensure it exists.
